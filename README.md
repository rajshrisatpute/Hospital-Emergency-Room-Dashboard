# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
This project presents a Power BI dashboard designed to help hospitals monitor and improve Emergency Room (ER) operations. It provides clear insights into patient flow, waiting times, treatment stages,  and areas where delays occur. The goal is to support better planning, reduce waiting time, and enhance the overall quality of patient care.
